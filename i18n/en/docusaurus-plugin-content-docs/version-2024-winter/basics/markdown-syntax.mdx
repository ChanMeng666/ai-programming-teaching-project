# Markdown Format Introduction

## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created in 2004 by John Gruber. It allows people to write documents in an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert them into valid HTML documents.

:::tip Advantages of Markdown

- Easy to learn: Syntax is concise and clear, with a gentle learning curve
- Plain text: Can be written with any text editor
- Rich formatting: Supports headings, lists, links, images, and many other formats
- Cross-platform: Can be read and edited on any device
- Focus on content: Allows authors to focus on writing rather than formatting

## Basic Markdown Syntax

### Heading Syntax

```markdown
# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
### Level 3 Heading
```

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Leave a blank line between paragraphs. If you want to break a line within a paragraph, add two spaces at the end of the line.

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
This line ends with two spaces.
This creates a line break.
```

### Emphasis Syntax

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
***Bold and Italic*** or ___Bold and Italic___
```

### List Syntax

Unordered lists:
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
```

Ordered lists:
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Link and Image Syntax

Links:
```markdown
[Link Text](URL "Optional Title")
Example: [Google](https://www.google.com "Google Search Engine")
```

Images:
```markdown
![Alt Text](Image URL "Optional Title")
```

### Quote Syntax

```markdown
> This is a quote.
>
> This is the second paragraph of the quote.
```

### Code Block Syntax

````markdown
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Table Syntax

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Content 1 | Content 2 | Content 3 |
| Content 4 | Content 5 | Content 6 |
```

### Task List Syntax

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [ ] Another incomplete task
```

### Horizontal Rule Syntax

Use three or more `-`, `*`, or `_`:

```markdown
---
***
___
```

:::note
If you need to use more complex formatting in Markdown, consider:
- Using more native Markdown syntax
- Appropriately using simple HTML tags
- Using extended syntax supported by your documentation system
